# Wraithnet API

Wraithnet is something I have been working on for a very long time now, and it continues to evolve and be a work in progress.

It all started with an idea that I wanted to have 1 customizable app to handle a variety of tasks instead of needing to have multiple apps to handle them all. Over the years, those tasks have changed, but the Wraithnet idea has never left me.

In this iteration, I set out to implement the backend of the project using Node, Typescript, Express and MongoDB to update it with modern development practices and increase it's efficiency and scalability. This proved very useful as I built a new feature into the app that scaled a bit quicker than I had anticipated.

## The Technicals

Wraithnet API is a RESTful API for Wraithnet built with the following technologies:
- Node
- Typescript
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

Like most of my applications, I host the Wraithnet API on [Render](https://render.com).

### Why Node
I chose to use Node for this project because I wanted to use a language that I was familiar with and that I knew would be able to handle the tasks I needed it to. I also wanted to use a language that would allow me to easily implement Typescript.

### Why Typescript
I've been using Typescript for a while now, and I honestly couldn't tell you the last time I worked on a project without it. I find tremendous value in the type safety and intellisense it provides, especially when working on teams. I've found that it helps me write better code, and to catch errors before they happen.

### Why Express
Express was an easy choice for me since I was already familiar with it, and it's a very popular framework for Node.

### Why MongoDB and Mongoose
I chose MongoDB because I wanted to use a NoSQL database for this project in order to become more familiar with them (not to mention Mongo Atlas has a great free tier). I chose Mongoose because I wanted to use an ORM to help me manage the database, and it was by far the most popular.
